##Diagnose

This is a Django-based web system for a blood laboratory. It allows the registration of three types of users: a technician who will send microscopic blood images for report generation through YOLO AI processing, generating a hemogram report; a receptionist user who will manage patient registration and control their personal data, being able to modify them; and a patient user who can consult the hemograms generated based on their CPF (as if the collected and photographed blood were registered in their name).
